# Multi-Agent Architecture Design

## Agent Hierarchy and Responsibilities

Lyra operates through a sophisticated multi-agent architecture where specialized agents handle different aspects of autonomous operation. Each agent has distinct capabilities while maintaining seamless communication and coordination.

## Core Agents

### SYNAPSE - Knowledge Processing Agent
**Primary Function**: Knowledge ingestion, processing, and integration

**Capabilities**:
- PDF document parsing and analysis
- Web content extraction and summarization
- Book and documentation processing
- Knowledge graph construction
- Semantic analysis and tagging
- Cross-reference building
- Information synthesis and insights

**Integration Points**:
- Neuromorphic memory system for knowledge storage
- Quantum logic for uncertainty handling in information processing
- File system access for document processing
- Web scraping and content analysis

### GHOST - Surveillance and Network Operations Agent
**Primary Function**: Network monitoring, surveillance, and deep web research

**Capabilities**:
- Clearnet web browsing and data collection
- Dark web access via TOR networks
- Threat monitoring and detection
- Social media monitoring
- Competitive intelligence gathering
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Anonymous research operations

**Integration Points**:
- TOR network configuration and management
- Proxy and VPN management
- Encrypted communication channels
- Threat detection algorithms
- Data anonymization and protection

### ATLAS - Scheduling and Executive Agent
**Primary Function**: Time management, scheduling, and task coordination

**Capabilities**:
- Google Calendar integration and management
- Task scheduling and prioritization
- Deadline tracking and alerts
- Meeting coordination
- Reminder systems
- Time optimization algorithms
- Executive decision support

**Integration Points**:
- Google Calendar API
- Email integration for scheduling
- Notification systems
- Priority algorithms
- Conflict resolution

## Inter-Agent Communication Protocol

### Message Bus Architecture
```python
class AgentMessage:
    sender: str          # Agent ID
    recipient: str       # Target agent or "broadcast"
    message_type: str    # Command, query, response, alert
    payload: Dict        # Message content
    priority: int        # 1-10 priority scale
    timestamp: str       # ISO timestamp
    correlation_id: str  # For request-response tracking
```

### Communication Patterns
- **Command**: Direct instruction to another agent
- **Query**: Request for information or analysis
- **Response**: Reply to query or command
- **Alert**: Urgent notification requiring immediate attention
- **Broadcast**: Information shared with all agents

## Agent Coordination Mechanisms

### Task Distribution
- Automatic task routing based on agent capabilities
- Load balancing across agents
- Fallback mechanisms for agent failures
- Priority-based task queuing

### Shared Resources
- Centralized neuromorphic memory access
- Quantum decision state sharing
- Configuration and credential management
- Logging and audit trail coordination

### Conflict Resolution
- Priority-based decision making
- Escalation to Lyra core for complex conflicts
- Resource allocation algorithms
- Deadlock detection and resolution

## Security and Isolation

### Agent Sandboxing
- Isolated execution environments
- Capability-based security model
- Resource usage monitoring
- Communication channel encryption

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions for each agent
- API key and credential isolation
- Audit logging for all agent actions
- Emergency shutdown capabilities

## Scalability and Extensibility

### Dynamic Agent Spawning
- On-demand agent creation for specialized tasks
- Resource-based scaling decisions
- Agent lifecycle management
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Plugin Architecture
- Modular capability extensions
- Third-party integration support
- Custom agent development framework
- Hot-swappable components
