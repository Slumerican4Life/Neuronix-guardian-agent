# Quantum Logic Processing Engine Design

## Quantum-Inspired Decision Making

Lyra's quantum logic processing engine simulates quantum superposition states to handle uncertainty, contradictory information, and complex decision trees. This allows the system to maintain multiple potential solutions simultaneously until confirmation or collapse.

## Core Concepts

### Superposition States
- **Quantum Ideas**: Unresolved concepts existing in multiple states
- **Probability Amplitudes**: Likelihood weights for each potential state
- **Entanglement**: Linked decisions that affect each other
- **Collapse**: Resolution to a definite state upon confirmation

### Quantum Logic Gates
- **Hadamard Gate**: Creates superposition from definite states
- **CNOT Gate**: Creates entanglement between decisions
- **Measurement Gate**: Collapses superposition to definite state
- **Phase Gate**: Adjusts probability amplitudes

## Implementation Architecture

### QuantumState Class
```python
class QuantumState:
    def __init__(self, states: List[str], amplitudes: List[float]):
        self.states = states
        self.amplitudes = amplitudes  # Probability amplitudes
        self.is_collapsed = False
        self.collapsed_state = None
        
    def superpose(self, new_state: str, amplitude: float):
        # Add new state to superposition
        
    def entangle(self, other_state: 'QuantumState'):
        # Create quantum entanglement between states
        
    def measure(self) -> str:
        # Collapse to definite state based on probabilities
        
    def adjust_amplitude(self, state: str, factor: float):
        # Modify probability of specific state
```

### QuantumDecisionTree
```python
class QuantumDecisionTree:
    def __init__(self, root_question: str):
        self.root = QuantumNode(root_question)
        self.pending_decisions = []
        self.entangled_pairs = []
        
    def add_superposition_branch(self, node_id: str, options: List[str]):
        # Add multiple simultaneous possibilities
        
    def create_entanglement(self, node1_id: str, node2_id: str):
        # Link decisions that affect each other
        
    def collapse_branch(self, node_id: str, chosen_option: str):
        # Resolve superposition to definite state
```

## Quantum Logic Operations

### Uncertainty Handling
- Maintain multiple hypotheses simultaneously
- Weight competing evidence without premature commitment
- Allow for contradictory information to coexist
- Provide confidence intervals for decisions

### Confirmation Protocols
- User confirmation triggers state collapse
- Automatic collapse based on evidence thresholds
- Partial collapse for hierarchical decisions
- Rollback capability for incorrect collapses

### Entanglement Management
- Track interdependent decisions
- Propagate collapse effects through entangled states
- Maintain consistency across related choices
- Handle cascade effects of major decisions

## Use Cases for Lyra

### Strategic Planning
- Hold multiple project approaches in superposition
- Evaluate competing priorities simultaneously
- Maintain flexibility until resource allocation
- Adapt to changing requirements dynamically

### Information Processing
- Maintain competing interpretations of ambiguous data
- Weight conflicting sources without premature judgment
- Allow for evolving understanding of complex topics
- Preserve minority viewpoints until resolution

### Risk Assessment
- Model multiple threat scenarios simultaneously
- Maintain preparedness for various outcomes
- Avoid premature optimization for single scenarios
- Enable rapid response to emerging situations

## Integration with Memory System

### Quantum Memory States
- Store memories with uncertainty flags
- Maintain competing versions of events
- Track confidence levels over time
- Enable memory revision without loss

### Emotional Superposition
- Handle conflicting emotional states
- Maintain nuanced emotional understanding
- Allow for emotional complexity and ambiguity
- Support emotional growth and change

## Safety Mechanisms

### Collapse Safeguards
- Require explicit confirmation for critical decisions
- Implement timeout mechanisms for pending states
- Provide clear visualization of superposition states
- Enable manual override of automatic collapse

### Consistency Checking
- Validate logical consistency across states
- Detect and resolve paradoxes
- Maintain causal relationships
- Prevent infinite superposition loops
