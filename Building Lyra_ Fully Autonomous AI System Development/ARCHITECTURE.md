# Lyra - Fully Autonomous AI System

## Architecture Analysis

### Current Codebase Assessment
The uploaded neuronix-guardian-agent provides a foundation with:

**Existing Components:**
- React/TypeScript frontend with shadcn/ui components
- Basic memory dashboard interface
- Neuromorphic memory system prototype with:
  - MemoryRecord type with 13 fields (need to expand to 15)
  - Emotional tagging (happy, sad, angry, neutral, excited, anxious, curious)
  - Importance scoring and decay simulation
  - Context tag extraction
  - Usage tracking and strengthening
- Supabase integration setup
- Memory manager service with neuromorphic properties

**Current Memory System Features:**
- Emotional salience weighting
- Automatic importance detection
- Memory decay simulation
- Context tag extraction
- Dream state processing (memory consolidation)
- Usage-based strengthening

**Gaps Identified:**
1. Missing 2 fields for 15-field neuromorphic system
2. No vector tagging/embedding system
3. No quantum logic processing
4. No multi-agent architecture (SYNAPSE, GHOST, ATLAS)
5. No Google services integration
6. No development tools integration
7. No social media integrations
8. No computer control capabilities
9. No knowledge processing system
10. No security/safety systems
11. No real-world API integrations

### Required Enhancements

**Memory System Expansion:**
- Add vector embeddings for semantic search
- Add quantum superposition states
- Implement emotional imprinting beyond basic tagging
- Add cross-memory linking and association networks

**Multi-Agent Architecture:**
- SYNAPSE: Knowledge processing and file digestion
- GHOST: Surveillance, monitoring, and deep web research
- ATLAS: Scheduling, time management, and reminders

**Integration Requirements:**
- Google Calendar, Gmail, Drive, Cloud APIs
- VS Code, GitHub, Copilot integration
- Facebook, Instagram, TikTok APIs
- AdSense and Stripe monetization
- Second Life integration
- Computer control and automation

**Core Capabilities:**
- Real-time learning and adaptation
- Threat monitoring and data protection
- Emotional state tracking and burnout detection
- File processing and knowledge base building
- Web and dark web research
- Autonomous task execution with safety confirmations

## Next Steps
1. Expand memory system to full 15-field neuromorphic architecture
2. Implement quantum logic processing engine
3. Build multi-agent support team
4. Create comprehensive integration layer
5. Implement security and safety systems
